My eight-year-old son Marco has a card game fever. We are not hardcore gamers in this family, but he enjoys every minute we spend playing Machi Koro, Exploding Kittens, Sushi Go or Go Nuts for Donuts.

He has the crazy imagination that you'd expect for a kid of his age, and he asked for some help to make his own card game. We are going through this long and fun process of choosing a topic, discussing mechanics,  prototyping, sketching, building digital models to stretch the rules... I never thought I'd have "creative differences" with my son this early.

The game name is "Party Poopers", and we are trying to make two set of rules: a fun-random-fast match, and something more focused on strategy. 

I'm trying to document everything in this repository, and I'm trying to read more about the basics of game design. If you are curious about the topic, you might want to check this list of the Board Game Design Lab.
