I'm trying to learn about card game design, and, oh boy, it is hard.

My eldest son Marco loves playing  Machi Koro, Exploding Kittens and Sushi Go. He also enjoys drawing and telling stories of "Birdy Wirdies," a series of fun birds with (super?) powers and often impossible character traits product of his imagination. So we thought that putting together both passions would make a fantastic parent-child activity.
